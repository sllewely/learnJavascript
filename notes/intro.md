# Intro

## Why Javascript

Why Javascript

- very popular, lots of jobs
- quick to make apps you can visually see and play around with
- primarily a frontend language, but it's also used in backend
- it runs on all web browsers and will for all time, meaning it will be around forever
- not a ton of overhead of knowledge required to make something, relatively easy
- a lot of core concepts in common with other programming languages

Drawbacks

- has some unfortunate gotchas
- because it's been a part of the internet for all time, old problems in the language will never be fixed, because it means breaking ancient websites.
- because it's old, you will find lots of old, outdated advice and references to old frameworks
- also need to understand some basic html, css to get started with a visual project

Beginner advice

- This is going to be partly an exercise in learning how to learn.  As a software engineer, you will encounter things you don't know how to do and get stuck, no matter how experiened you are.  Perserverence and exploration/curiosity are part of being a good engineer
- Try everything out.  If you're wondering what would happen if you do X, try it :)
- #1 mistake I see beginners make is trying to do too much at once

We're going to learn not just javascript, but other day-to-day things you would use as a programmer.

Stack Overflow and googling questions

Trying things out in console.log, inspection and developer tools, starting with a webpage on your computer

Open developer tools with cmd + shift + i / ctrl + shift + i

First problems: variables, strings, control flow. Try out in browser
