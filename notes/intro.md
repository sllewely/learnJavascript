# Intro

## Why Javascript

Why Javascript

- very popular, lots of jobs
- quick to make apps you can visually see and play around with
- primarily a frontend language, but it's also used in backend
- it runs on all web browsers and will for all time, meaning it will be around forever
- not a ton of overhead of knowledge required to make something, relatively easy
- a lot of core concepts in common with other programming languages

Drawbacks

- has some unfortunate gotchas
- because it's been a part of the internet for all time, old problems in the language will never be fixed, because it means breaking ancient websites.
- because it's old, you will find lots of old, outdated advice and references to old frameworks
- also need to understand some basic html, css to get started with a visual project

Beginner advice

- This is going to be partly an exercise in learning how to learn.  As a software engineer, you will encounter things you don't know how to do and get stuck, no matter how experiened you are.  Perserverence and exploration/curiosity are part of being a good engineer
- Try everything out.  If you're wondering what would happen if you do X, try it :)
- #1 mistake I see beginners make is trying to do too much at once

We're going to learn not just javascript, but other day-to-day things you would use as a programmer.

## Try it out

Check out the light bulb example on this page:

[W3Schools JS Intro tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_intro.asp)

Play around with the [lightbulb example](https://www.w3schools.com/js/tryit.asp?filename=tryjs_intro_lightbulb).

Also look at: what are html tags?  What are html attributes?  What part of it is Javascript, and how does it know to update the lightbulb image?

Then update the code to replace the off lightbulb with this image of cats.  https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Ffarm4.staticflickr.com%2F3153%2F2800697500_2c3473728d_q_d.jpg&f=1&nofb=1

---

Install VS Code and open a new file.

Save the code from [this](https://www.w3schools.com/js/tryit.asp?filename=tryjs_output_dom) example into a new vs code file.

What is happening in this example?  Try out some experiments and change things and see what happens.

Now copy and paste in the button code and replace it to update some text in an element on click.

**end day 1**

Homework:

Make a web page.

## Day 2

Other terminology to know

    javascript != java, but it is ECMAScript
    IDE
    HTML and CSS
    NodeJS, React, Typescript etc

Stack Overflow and googling questions

Trying things out in console.log, inspection and developer tools, starting with a webpage on your computer

Open developer tools with cmd + shift + i / ctrl + shift + i

First problems: variables, strings, control flow. Try out in browser

W3School Javascript tutorial

Install vscode

Homework: open code in vscode & play around
